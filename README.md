# MSP430-Blinky-Toy
For my project utilizing C, my task was to use the MSP430 Microcontroller and my creativity to design a toy. Each MSP430 board is equipped with buttons, LED's, a speaker, and an LED screen. Utilizing these features and my knowledge of I/O, develop a program to turn the board into a toy.

This toy should:

* generate sounds,
* dynamically change the LEDs that are illuminated, both brighly and dimmly,
* implement a state machine to maintain the state of the toy,
* and use the four buttons on the expansion board (P2.0-3) to transition the state machine.

**At least one of the functions to transition the state machine was written in assembly language.**

## Getting Started 

Inside this repository you will find two directories:
1. The 'demos' directory contains sample programs for you to review and learn from. These example programs are a great starting point in understanding how to program the MSP430 microcontroller. See the readme in the demo directory on how to compile and run the demo programs.
2. The 'project' directory should contain the source code for your toy.
